# ALX Listing App

## Project Description

The ALX Listing App is an Airbnb clone listing page that allows users to browse and book various properties.

## Project Structure

- `components/`: Contains reusable components such as Button and Card.
  - `common/Button.tsx`: Defines a reusable Button component for actions like “Book Now,” “Details,” etc.
  - `common/Card.tsx`: Defines a reusable Card component to display information about various properties.
- `interfaces/`: Contains TypeScript interfaces related to the project.
  - `index.ts`: Placeholder interfaces for CardProps and ButtonProps.
- `constants/`: Stores reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text.
- `public/assets/`: Stores static assets such as images and icons.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
